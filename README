The programs in this distribution are re-implementations of games for
the Linux console.

Three games are included with this distribution:

* cblocks (sliding-block puzzles),
* cmines (a minesweeper-based game), and
* csokoban (sokoban).

Alternate versions are included, which do not need to be played on the
console. However, these versions lack the font-altered images and full
mouse support.

INSTALLING

To build and install all the games, the usual incantation will
suffice: ./configure ; make ; make install.

Useful arguments to ./configure include: --bindir, which defaults to
/usr/local/games, --mandir, which defaults to /usr/local/man, and
--datadir, which defaults to /usr/local/share.

In addition, you can use --with-ncurses to build the ncurses-based
versions of the programs instead of the Linux console versions, and
--disable-mouse to build the programs without mouse support.

See the README files in each directory for more information.

JUSTIFICATION

One day I was playing Xsokoban when it struck me that this game
clearly was originally created for a text terminal. Curious, I did
some hunting around, and finally found one curses-based implementation
of sokoban, a Linux 1.x port from Minix code (which in turn had been
ported at least once before). I realized that the X version of the
game had completely eclipsed its origins at the terminal.

I'm not a big fan of GUIs for the sake of graphics. Pretty pictures
are nice, but text mode is where I spend most of my time. And the
Linux console has many extremely advanced features for a text
terminal, yet I just don't see many programs taking advantage of them.

I decided to rewrite some of my favorite games for the Linux console,
so I could play them without X, pretty pictures and all.

THE FINE PRINT

The programs in this distribution are free software. The software is
distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version
2 (or, at your option, any later version). See COPYING for specifics.

Bug reports and other comments should be directed to myself.

Share and enjoy.
